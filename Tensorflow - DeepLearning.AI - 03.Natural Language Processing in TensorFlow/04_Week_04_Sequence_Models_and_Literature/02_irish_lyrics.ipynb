        "\n",
        "In the previous lab, you trained a model on just a single song. You might have found that the output text can quickly become gibberish or repetitive. Even if you tweak the hyperparameters, the model will still be limited by its vocabulary of only 263 words. The model will be more flexible if you train it on a much larger corpus and that's what you'll be doing in this lab. You will use lyrics from more Irish songs then see how the generated text looks like. You will also see how this impacts the process from data preparation to model training. Let's get started!"
